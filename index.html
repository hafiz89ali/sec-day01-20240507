      Besides of administration work, I learn some Google Appsript coding to
      help my daily chores and to be used by teachers and others. I also learn
      how to build Wordpress website for school. However, due to limited time
      and I have to learn by myself, I cannot do a lot. I know that i love to
      code and I dream to code everyday.
